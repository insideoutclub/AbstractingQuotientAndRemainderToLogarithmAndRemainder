# Abstracting Quotient And Remainder To Logarithm And Remainder

I have benefitted greatly from multiple readings of  *Elements of Programming* by Alexander Stepanov and Paul McJones as well as *From Mathematics to Generic Programming* by Stepanov and Daniel Rose. One algorithm that receives extensive coverage early in both books is the Egyptian multiplication algorithm. If you plug addition in to the algorithm, it performs multiplication (n x a) in O(n) steps. If you plug multiplication in to the algorithm, it computes powers an.
